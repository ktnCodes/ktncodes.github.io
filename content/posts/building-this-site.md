## Why I Rebuilt It

My old site was a static HTML portfolio built on the [HTML5 UP Hyperspace](https://html5up.net/hyperspace) template — a few pages showcasing college projects and a PDF resume. It looked fine, but it was a dead end. Adding content meant editing raw HTML. There was no way to blog, organize by topic, or search.

I wanted something I could actually grow with: a place to write notes, document learning, and publish posts without touching HTML. The inspiration was [pbrazeale.github.io](https://pbrazeale.github.io) — an engineer who maintains a public notebook of weekly logs, technical deep-dives, and learning notes.

The tool I used to plan and execute the migration: Claude Code, running as an agentic engineering assistant. Fitting, given that agentic engineering is one of the main topics I want to write about here.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Static site generator | [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) |
| Theme | [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages |
| Deployment | GitHub Actions |
| Content format | Markdown |

### Why Hugo?

- **Fast**: Builds hundreds of pages in under a second
- **No runtime**: Outputs pure static HTML — no Node, no server
- **Markdown-first**: Write posts as `.md` files, Hugo handles the rest
- **Active ecosystem**: Large theme library, good docs, frequent releases

### Why PaperMod?

- Built-in search (JSON index, no external service)
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Table of contents on posts
- Reading time estimates
- Code copy buttons
- Archive and tag pages out of the box

---

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A GitHub account with a `<username>.github.io` repository
- Hugo extended edition (see install below)

---

## Setup: Fresh Install

### 1. Install Hugo (Windows)

```bash
winget install Hugo.Hugo.Extended
```

Restart your terminal, then verify:

```bash
hugo version
# hugo v0.157.0+extended ...
```

> **Mac/Linux**: Use `brew install hugo` or see the [Hugo install docs](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

### 2. Initialize the Hugo site

If you're working in an existing git repo (like a GitHub Pages repo), use `--force` to initialize Hugo without needing an empty directory:

```bash
hugo new site . --force
```

This creates the following structure:

```
.
├── archetypes/       # Templates for new content
├── content/          # Your markdown posts and pages
├── data/             # Optional data files
├── hugo.toml         # Site configuration
├── i18n/             # Internationalization (optional)
├── layouts/          # Custom layout overrides
├── static/           # Static files (images, fonts, etc.)
└── themes/           # Installed themes
```

### 3. Add the PaperMod theme

Add PaperMod as a git submodule so it can be tracked and updated independently:

```bash
git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod
```

### 4. Configure `hugo.toml`

Replace the default config with your own. Here's the config used for this site:

```toml
baseURL = "https://ktncodes.github.io/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "ktnCodes"
theme = "PaperMod"
paginate = 10

[params]
  author = "Kevin Nguyen"
  description = "Engineering notebook — agentic engineering, embedded systems, and software development"
  env = "production"
  defaultTheme = "auto"         # Follows OS dark/light preference
  ShowReadingTime = true
  ShowPostNavLinks = true
  ShowBreadCrumbs = true
  ShowCodeCopyButtons = true
  ShowToc = true
  TocOpen = false

  [params.homeInfoParams]
    Title = "ktnCodes"
    Content = "Engineering notebook on agentic engineering, embedded systems, and building things."

  [[params.socialIcons]]
    name = "github"
    url = "https://github.com/ktnCodes"

  [[params.socialIcons]]
    name = "linkedin"
    url = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/itskevtrinh/"

  [[params.socialIcons]]
    name = "rss"
    url = "/index.xml"

[menu]
  [[menu.main]]
    identifier = "posts"
    name = "Posts"
    url = "/posts/"
    weight = 10

  [[menu.main]]
    identifier = "tags"
    name = "Tags"
    url = "/tags/"
    weight = 20

  [[menu.main]]
    identifier = "about"
    name = "About"
    url = "/about/"
    weight = 30

  [[menu.main]]
    identifier = "archives"
    name = "Archives"
    url = "/archives/"
    weight = 40

  [[menu.main]]
    identifier = "search"
    name = "Search"
    url = "/search/"
    weight = 50

[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "RSS", "JSON"]   # JSON is required for the search feature
```

### 5. Create required PaperMod pages

PaperMod's Archives and Search features require dedicated content files:

**`content/archives.md`**
```markdown
---
title: "Archives"
layout: "archives"
url: "/archives/"
summary: "archives"
---
```

**`content/search.md`**
```markdown
---
title: "Search"
layout: "search"
url: "/search/"
summary: "search"
placeholder: "Search posts..."
---
```

### 6. Create a `.gitignore`

```
# Hugo build output
public/
resources/
.hugo_build.lock

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE
.vs/
.vscode/
.idea/
```

### 7. Set up GitHub Actions for deployment

Create `.github/workflows/hugo.yaml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: pages
  cancel-in-progress: false

defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      HUGO_VERSION: 0.157.0
    steps:
      - name: Install Hugo CLI
        run: |
          wget -O ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb \
          && sudo dpkg -i ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb

      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: recursive   # Required to pull in PaperMod theme
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Pages
        id: pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5

      - name: Build with Hugo
        env:
          HUGO_CACHEDIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo_cache
        run: |
          hugo \
            --gc \
            --minify \
            --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/"

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./public

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### 8. Enable GitHub Actions in repo settings

In your GitHub repository:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
3. Save

This is the step people most commonly forget. Without it, the workflow runs but nothing deploys.

## How to Use It: Day-to-Day Workflow

### Writing a new post

```bash
hugo new posts/my-post-title.md
```

This creates a new file at `content/posts/my-post-title.md` using your archetype template. Edit it with your content:

```markdown
---
title: "My Post Title"
date: 2026-03-14T00:00:00Z
draft: true
tags: ["agentic-engineering", "notes"]
summary: "One sentence description for the post list."
ShowToc: true
---

Your content here.
```

When you're ready to publish, set `draft: false`.

### Preview locally

```bash
hugo server -D
```

The `-D` flag includes draft posts. Open `http://localhost:1313` in your browser. The server hot-reloads on file changes — no refresh needed.

### Build the site (optional, CI does this automatically)

```bash
hugo --gc --minify
```

Output goes to `public/`. Don't commit this folder — GitHub Actions builds it fresh on every push.

### Publish

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add post: my post title"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions picks up the push, builds the site, and deploys it to `https://ktncodes.github.io/`. Takes about 30-60 seconds.

### Update the PaperMod theme

```bash
git submodule update --remote themes/PaperMod
git commit -m "Update PaperMod theme"
git push
```

## Content Organization

Posts live in `content/posts/`. Tags are the primary way to organize content — there are no categories. Any tag you add to a post's front matter automatically gets a tag page at `/tags/<tag-name>/`.

Useful tags to start with:

| Tag | Use for |
|-----|---------|
| `agentic-engineering` | Posts about AI agents, Claude, agentic workflows |
| `notes` | Short knowledge captures |
| `meta` | Posts about the site itself |
| `portfolio` | Legacy project write-ups |
| `embedded-systems` | Hardware and low-level work |
