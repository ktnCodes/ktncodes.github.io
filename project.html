							<h1 class="major">Cloud-based Photo Gallery</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/cloudapp2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2 class="major">Project Overview: </h2>
							<dt>We were tasked to create a cloud-based photo gallery application. We split the project into three different parts. 
							</li>Create an Amazon RDS relational database instance</li> 
							</li>Implement a Flask web framework </li>
							</li>Deploy your application on an EC2 instance. </li> </dt>
							<h2 class="major">Contibution:</h2>
							<dt>My job was implmenting the EC2 instance to our project in order for us to run in on the AWS backend servers.</dt>
							<h2 class="major">Learned Skills:</h2>
							<dt>Worked with AWS RDS database and used python to create the tables on on our EC2 instance. </dt>
							<h2 class="major">Resources Used:</h2>
							<dt> Our group used the textbook which it provided useful steps and examples in Python code.
								There are several good tutorials online.
							  	Example: https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html </dt>

							<h1 class="major">Card Game Application</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/cardapp1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2 class="major">Project Overview: </h2>
							<dt>Our project involved us to create a Android based application by implmenting the use of Android Studio. Our group decided to create a universal online 52-card playing card platform. The users can play/create card games using the in-client editor and compete against other players in online games. Because of the pandemic, playing card games with friends in person became more difficult and dangerous so creating an online playing card platform that fulfills that urge to do is being addressed. There will be a server that contains game inventory and current game rooms, which is connected to by the android/web client. The client has the ability to create game rooms from an existing game, or the option to create a new game using the web-editor. The games will consist of a complex class hierarchy that will allow the user to create different games whilst still using the same api as every other game. </dt>
							<h2 class="major">Contibution:</h2>
							<dt>My role was to implment the frontend development of the application. I was tasked to design the app layout and create the game UI functionality. </dt>
							<h2 class="major">Learned Skills:</h2>
							<dt>I mainly used Java to write the code in this project while also used agile development to track our team status every other week. </dt>
							<h2 class="major">Resources Used:</h2>
							<dt>Connecting website page front-end html, javascript with other possible additional APIs with back-end android studio utilizing java to create the programs for the games. </dt>

					<section id="main" class="wrapper">
						<div class="inner">
							<h1 class="major">BoomBa Project</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/boomba.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2 class="major">Project Overview: </h2>
							<dt>CprE 288 is an embedded systems course that focuses on creating scripts to control a Roomba robot vacuum. The final project of this course was to work on small teams and create a situation that can be simulated using a Roomba and program an application to solve that situation. Our group decided to simulate a military bot that can scout out a room of objects placed on the field. Our solution is to use a relatively common and out-of-the-ordinary cleaning robot and make it a recon bot in order to scout these buildings with relatively little risk. In addition, if need be, there is a last resort option in case things get too messy. </dt>
							<h2 class="major">Contibution:</h2>
							<dt>The project involved coding the functions of the Roomba in C so that it would run on a microcontroller on the physical Boomba. My role on this project was to map out and develop ideas for the robot and also test the code for the BOOMba. </dt>
							<h2 class="major">Learned Skills:</h2>
							<dt>My role in this project was a programmer where I was tasked with creating the interface and connecting all the pieces together. I expanded my knowledge of C and also learned how to develop a user interface. I also learned the source code for embedded systems works. </dt>
